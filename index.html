      <h1>Imran Khan Niazi</h1>
      <p>
        Imran Khan is a leader who dreamed of turning Pakistan into a welfare
        state like Madinah. He raised his voice against every corrupt leader and
        fought for the rights of the people. Today, he is in jail because of his
        honesty, truthfulness, and courage. Yet, millions of people still wait
        eagerly to see and hear him. He is not just a politician â€” he is a
        symbol of hope.
